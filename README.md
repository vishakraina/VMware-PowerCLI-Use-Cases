- Scripts/01_VM_Inventory.ps1          : VM inventory report
- Scripts/02_VM_Performance.ps1        : VM performance summary
- Scripts/03_Snapshot_Report.ps1       : Snapshot report and cleanup
- Scripts/04_VM_Power_Operations.ps1   : VM power operations (Start/Stop/Restart)

Usage:
1. Copy the 'VMwareReports' folder to C:\ (or keep the path and update scripts accordingly).
2. Run C:\VMwareReports\Credentials\_Credential_Manager.ps1 to store credentials (first time only).
3. Run any script from the Scripts folder. They will auto-load credentials and connect to vCenter.
4. Reports will be saved to C:\VMwareReports\Reports and logs to C:\VMwareReports\Logs\execution_log.txt

Security:
- Credentials are stored using Export-Clixml which uses DPAPI to protect credentials to the current user.
- Do NOT copy the vc_credentials.xml file to another machine or user.

Notes:
- Customize thresholds and VM lists in each script as required by your environment.
- The orphaned VM detection script contains a placeholder region â€” please adapt to your datastore browsing needs.
